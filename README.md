A bot where you make questions, and place answers! the answers can be wacky, weird and most of the time funny! just remember not to use any prohibited words.

You could say /궁금증 question: answer: to write simple tasks for the bot to make questions and answer them.

to make the bot answer these questions, say "응답아 {question}"
and the bot will answer this question. 

however, if the question/answer has a certain prohibited word, the question will not be made.
